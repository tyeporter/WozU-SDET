# GTranslateSelenium (Lab A) [11-03-2020]

The goal of this lab is to create a new project that has tests using Selenium and TestNG.

**This project assumes you are using Brave Browser on a Mac. If you are using Chrome on a Mac, delete the line `ChromeOptions options = new ChromeOptions().setBinary("/Applications/Brave Browser.app/Contents/MacOS/Brave Browser");`, and replace the line `driver = new ChromeDriver(options);` with `driver = new ChromeDriver();` in the `GTranslateHomeTest.java` file. For other computer and browser setups please visit this [page](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/).**
