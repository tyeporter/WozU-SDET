# [MatrixCellsProblem (LeetCode #1252)](https://leetcode.com/problems/cells-with-odd-values-in-a-matrix) [10-14-2020]

Given `n` and `m` which are the dimensions of a matrix initialized by zeros and given an array `indices` where `indices[i] = [ri, ci]`. For each pair of `[ri, ci]` you have to increment all cells in row `ri` and column `ci` by 1.

Return the number of cells with odd values in the matrix after applying the increment to all `indices`.
