# LRUCacheProblem (LeetCode #146) [10-13-2020]

## Problem
Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache.

Implement the LRUCache class:
- LRUCache(int capacity) Initialize the LRU cache with positive size capacity.
- int get(int key) Return the value of the key if the key exists, otherwise return -1.
- void put(int key, int value) Update the value of the key if the key exists. Otherwise, add the key-value pair to the cache. If the number of keys exceeds the capacity from this operation, evict the least recently used key.

### Todo
- Do `get` and `put` in O(1) time complexity.
