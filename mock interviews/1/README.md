# Mock Interview Review #1

## Things to Improve On

### Soft Skills
 - Be a bit more conversational when interviewer asks about my background
 - Think about the "What is something that you are proud of?" question

### Technical Skills

- Study the specific SDLC Models / Frameworks
	- Waterfall
    	- The first widely used SDLC model in software engineering. The process is divided into separate sequential phases where the output of the previous phase acts a input for the next phase. The process is seen as flowing steadily downwards like a waterfall.
    	- The phases of the waterfall model are:
        	- Requirement analysis
            	- Gathering and document project requirements
          	- Systems design
            	- The system architecture / design is prepared from the output of the requirement analysis
          	- Implementation
            	- Development is started with smaller programs called units. These smaller units are then tested.
          	- Integration
            	- The units built in the implementation phase are integrated into the system. The entire system is then tested for any bugs
          	- Deployment
            	- The product is deployed after after its passes all tests and meets all requirements
          	- Maintenance
            	- Issues that come up in the client environment are fixed and product enhancements are made.
      	- Advantages
        	- Simple and easy to understand and use
        	- Easy to manage due to the rigidity of the model.
      	- Disadvantages
        	- No working software is produced until late during the life cycle.
        	- High amounts of risk and uncertainty.
  	- Agile
    	- A combination of the iterative and incremental models. This model breaks the project into small incremental iterations with each iteration lasting from about one to three weeks. At the end of each iteration, a working product is deployed to the customer and important stakeholders.
    	- Each iteration involves the phases:
        	- Planning
        	- Requirement analysis
        	- Designing
        	- Building
        	- Testing
        	- Acceptance testing
      	- The agile method aims follows these four principles:
        	- **Individuals and Interactions**: self-organization and motivation are important, as are interactions like co-location and pair programming.
        	- **Working software**: The best means of understanding the customer's requirements is to demo working software instead of only relying on documentation.
        	- **Customer collaboration**: Continuous customer interaction is very important to get proper product requirements.
        	- **Respond to change**: Agile development is focused on quick responses to change and continuos development.
      	- Advantages
        	- Is a very realistic approach to software development.
        	- Promotes teamwork and cross training.
      	- Disadvantages
        	- Not suitable for handling complex dependencies.
        	- More risk of sustainability, maintainability and extensibility.
	- Iterative
    	- ...
	- Big Bang
    	- ...
	- Spiral
    	- ...
	- V-Model
    	- ...

- Use built-in data structures and algorithms to solve problems
